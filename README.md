# ShareIt - an application aimed to support recording and sharing digital content.

## Goals
ShareIt aims to provide a simple interface to allow users to record Digital Content and share it.

### Current plans
- A basic plugin system to support custom-sharing platforms and basic implementation of them for various formats like Imgur.
- Add my DirectX hook classes to support overlays and device capturing (such as for directx device video recordings).
